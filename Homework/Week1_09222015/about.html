<h1><i>Started From the Bottom Now We're Here</i></h1>
<p>I'm Mike Bagliebter but most people call me Bags.  I grew up in the northern suburbs of Manhattan but I hate when people call it upstate.  I'm fascinated by technology and innovation.  I'm taking this class to eventually build some of my own ideas and have some fun!</p>
